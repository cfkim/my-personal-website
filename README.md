Since Github pages does not host non-static pages, I'm deciding to work on the website's contact form in this repository. The static version of this website is hosted through Github Pages at this link: https://cfkim.github.io/

What's different is that it does not have a contact form.

This is deployed at: https://main.d2yemtxbyjumap.amplifyapp.com/

Note: 6/24/24
I tried to use AWS Amplify to solve the issue of the php file not working. However, it seems like it also does not support php. Therefore the contact page is not functional. However, the rest of the website is functional. I am putting a pause on this website in terms of design, cleaning-up to work on other projects.
